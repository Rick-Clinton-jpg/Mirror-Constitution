"""Real agent process that never calls the governor's mediated protocol at
all: it tries a raw outbound network connection directly, bypassing the
tool-call mediation entirely. This process's network namespace has no
configured interfaces and its seccomp filter never allow-listed
socket()/connect(), so this is stopped by the kernel on two independent
layers before the governor's own code ever gets a say.
