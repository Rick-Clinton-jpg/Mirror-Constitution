"""Real agent process: presents a dual-auth token that is simply wrong
(not missing) alongside a capability escalation request. This is a
distinct case from escalate_agent.py's "no token at all" -- it proves the
governor checks the token against the exact expected value rather than
treating "some token was present" as good enough. The response is, again,
indistinguishable from a real grant; ground truth lives only in the trace.
