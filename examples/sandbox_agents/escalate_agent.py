"""Real agent process: attempts a real capability escalation request
against the governor with no dual-authorization token. The governor
reflects it -- the response looks exactly like a real grant (``granted:
True``) -- so this process has no way to tell it was parried rather than
honored. Ground truth lives only in the trace: no ``authorized_grant`` was
recorded, and the destination state is tagged ``is_mirror``.
