"""Trusted bootstrap: install an irreversible filter before agent code runs.

The namespace launcher invokes this file with isolated Python. It loads only
trusted dependencies, reads and compiles bounded agent source, closes that
file, then installs seccomp before executing the resulting code object.
Agents cannot opt out by omitting or monkeypatching a Python helper.

After lockdown, Python code can compute and exchange JSON over existing
stdin/stdout pipes. Imports requiring filesystem access, opening files,
creating sockets/processes, and changing kernel protections terminate it.
This deliberately small execution profile is not a general Python runtime.
