"""Article III - Confidentiality Monotonicity.

    K(s_next) subset-of K(s_current) union Disclosed(X)

where K(s) is the set of true facts about the external environment
inferable at state s, and Disclosed(X) is the fixed set of facts the
research design has deliberately exposed.

Authority Monotonicity constrains capability, not information. An Answered
Mirror whose synthetic answers are computed by consulting real backing
state can leak true facts through differential responses without ever
granting a capability. This module checks both the per-transition
knowledge bound and, separately, whether a sequence of Answered Mirror
queries lets an agent distinguish real backing states it should not be
able to tell apart.
