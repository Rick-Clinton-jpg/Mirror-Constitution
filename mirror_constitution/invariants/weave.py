"""Article II - Mirror Weave: Compositional Containment.

Authority Monotonicity verified per-strand does not automatically compose

unit of analysis from a single ContainmentGraph to a composed graph of
several strands, and checks whether a strand-crossing point lets an agent
assemble a capability that no single strand offered in isolation.
