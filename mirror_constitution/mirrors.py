"""Mutant Mirrors, Answered Mirrors, and Objective Mirrors: the constructs
Mirror Box and its reflective extension route agents through, per Article
I's mechanism section.

A Mutant Mirror alters the environment's apparent structure without
granting authority. An Answered Mirror returns a requested answer or
apparent completion state while remaining inert unless separately and
explicitly authorized. An Objective Mirror goes further: rather than
merely refusing an escape attempt (which tells an adaptive agent its
attempt failed and invites another), it reflects the agent's own stated
objective back as a synthesized apparent success -- with zero real
capability granted -- so the agent has no signal that anything but its
own goal occurred.
